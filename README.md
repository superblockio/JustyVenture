JustyVenture
============

JustyVenture is our custom engine created specifically to make silly pointless text adventures for our friend to complete before he can open his present each Christmas.

Version History
============

2.0 (in progress)
Completely scrapped version 1.0 for a new system weâ€™re building from the ground up,
which will let us create new adventures more rapidly by writing them in XML.


1.0
Initial version of the engine that we whimisally used and modified at will for several
years in a row, without giving a thought to versioning.
